# Letter Recognition

 A convolutional neural network implemented with Keras and TensorFlow. It uses a MNIST-like dataset with 26 uppercase alphanumeric symbols. The model is trained using data generated with [data-generator.py](data-generator.py), once trained the weights are saved and [converted](https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/import-keras.html) to a format supported by TensorFlow.js.
